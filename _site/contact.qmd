The Data Center student fellows hold office hours in the Data Center's office (Anne ground floor) to answer questions and help with assignments.
Drop by to office hours if you're looking for some data science help, whether for a data encounter in a course, another UCR course, or your SEPR!

# Office hour schedule

Office hours are held in the Data Center's office (Anne ground floor), every week during the semester between week 4 and week 15.
You are welcome to drop by any time during the office hours, no appointment needed.

Office hours are with the current Data Center interns; you can learn more about their specific expertise below the schedule.
