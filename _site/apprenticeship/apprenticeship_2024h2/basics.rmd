```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE)
```

# Installation and setup: prepare in advance

Before the first workshop, please make sure that you have access to R and RStudio on your laptop. If you need help with the installation, please follow [this tutorial](../../../tutorials/r_install.rmd).

In addition the [R basics tutorial](../../../tutorials/r_basics.rmd) on the Data Center website explains the RStudio interface, and shows how to create a new project and how to install packages.

As a first step, please create a new project in your preferred working directory for these workshops, install the `tidyverse` package, and load it in your R session at the top of a new script. Note that packages need to be installed only once, but need to be loaded at the beginning of each new R session.

```{r}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

# Objectives

## Why R?

-   Free and open-source
-   Reproducible
-   Widely used in academia and industry; up-to-date with the latest technological developments
-   Very versatile: extensive package ecosystem for statistics and more
-   Powerful data wrangling and visualization capabilities
-   Extensive community support (open-access books, tutorials, forums, AI tools, etc.)

## Why `tidyverse`?

-   Clean, consistent, intuitive, readable syntax for all steps of the data analysis process
-   Limited set of functions that can be combined in many ways
-   Many packages beyond core `tidyverse` with the same underlying design, grammar, and data structures, therefore easier to learn advanced techniques

Note: a major advantage of using R is the ability to define custom functions. So if some of the methods and workflows used in RMET classes do not have sufficiently straightforward R implementations, UCR can develop its own functions (and even package) to streamline the process and give students quick and easy functions. See for example the `qacr` package developed for a similar purpose at Wesleyan University: [qacr website](https://rkabacoff.github.io/qacr/articles/qacr.html).
