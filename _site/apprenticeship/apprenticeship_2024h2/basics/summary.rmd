```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("data/data.csv")
```

To get a descriptive statistic of a single variable in a tibble, we can use that variable as an argument to a relevant function (using `$` to refer to a variable in a tibble).

```{r}
mean(data$age)
median(data$age)
sd(data$grade)
```

To get the frequencies of a categorical variable, we can use the `count()` function, with the `sort = TRUE` argument returning the values in descending frequency. `count()` is a tidy function that works well with pipe workflows and can count the joint frequencies of multiple variables.

```{r}
# frequencies of a single variable
count(data, reading)

# joint frequency distribution
count(data, reading, listening, notes)
```

To get the correlation coefficient between two variables, we can use the `cor()` function in the same way we used other descriptives such as `mean()`.

```{r}
cor(data$age, data$grade)
```

The easiest way to get summary statistics of all variables in a tibble is with the `summary()` function: this function shows the distribution of numeric variables, the frequencies of categorical variables, and the number of missing values for each variable.

```{r}
summary(data)
```

The `summary()` function is useful for viewing the data in the Console, but doesn't export to outside of R nicely. There are a few packages available for generating simple summary statistics tables that contain information about the central tendencies and dispersion of the data, such as `vtable` or `stargazer` (with many more available). These packages all have different default settings, output types, and customization options.

```{r}
library(vtable)
library(stargazer)

# vtable

data |> 
  # by default creates HTML table; out = "csv" returns a dataframe
  # can change which descriptives to keep
  # can report group-level descriptives
  sumtable(out = "csv", group = "reading")

# stargazer

data |> 
  # input needs to be a data.frame, not tibble
  as.data.frame() |> 
  # default output is LaTeX table
  # can be exported with the out argument or a following write() function
  # can change which descriptives to keep or omit
  # limited to numeric variables
  stargazer(type = "text")
```

Alternatively, we can define our own summary statistics with the `dplyr` functions `group_by()` and `summarize()`, which also easily allows the calculation of more complex descriptive statistics, including grouped statistics based on categorical variables. The `across()` helper function in the `summarize()` function can be used to apply the same calculation to multiple variables at once: it requires the first argument as the list of variables (potentially with the help of selector functions) and the function we'd like to apply.

```{r}
# tibble of mean and sd for a single variable
data |> 
  summarize(mean_grade = mean(grade),
            sd_grade = sd(grade))

# mean and sd of age and grade variables, grouped by reading
data |> 
  group_by(reading) |> 
  # .names allows overriding default option to reuse original column names
  summarize(across(c(age, grade), mean, .names = "mean_{.col}"),
            across(c(age, grade), sd, .names = "sd_{.col}"))

# mean of all numeric variables, grouped by reading
data |> 
  group_by(reading) |> 
  # where() is a helper function evaluating the contents of variables
  # specify full function call with ~ at the start and .x replacing the variable name
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))

# mean of all variables with names containing the letter a
data |> 
  summarize(across(contains("a"), ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))

# sample size of each group and correlation between age and grade per group
data |> 
  group_by(reading, listening) |> 
  summarize(age_grade_correlation = cor(age, grade),
            n = n())
```

The list of helper functions that can be used instead of listing which variables to include/exclude is in the help file accessible with `?dplyr_tidy_select`.

To export a descriptive statistics table, we can use the relevant `write...()` function shown in the data importing section (e.g. `write_csv()` for tibbles, general `write()` for HTML, plain text, LaTeX, other general types). CSV tables already copy nicely into e.g. MS Word. If using LaTeX or RMarkdown, the `knitr` package contains the `kable()` function that directly improves on the design of the table without needing formatting afterwards.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data |> 
  count(reading, listening) |> 
  write_csv("table1.csv")
```

```{r}
data |> 
  count(reading, listening) |> 
  # knitr:: allows using function from the package without library(knitr)
  knitr::kable()
```
