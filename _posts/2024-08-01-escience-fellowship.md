We are happy to announce that [Tina Rozsos](https://www.ucr.nl/academics/academic-program/faculty/academic-staff/tina-rozsos-b-a/), the the UCR Data Center's Graduate Fellow, has been selected as one of the 2024--2025 eScience Fellows at the Netherlands eScience Center. 
The fellowship programme supports individuals who promote or improve the use of open and sustainable research software within their community. 
[Tina's project](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/fellowship-programme/tina-rozsos/) focuses on improving the visibility of the Data Center and its activities at UCR.
In the coming year, we will improve the quality and accessibility of our online resources, and increase our offline presence by expanding the Center's activities to feature more regular events throughout the academic year.
By building a community around the Data Center and the use of research software across the curriculum, we hope that faculty and students can share their experiences of working with data, collaborate, and learn general skills and best practices for reproducible research. 

This is the second year that the Data Center's activities are supported by an eScience Fellowship. 
The [previous fellowship](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/fellowship-programme/alexei-karas/), held by our director [Dr. Alexei Karas](https://www.ucr.nl/academics/academic-program/faculty/academic-staff/dr-alexei-karas/), focused on piloting the Data Center's Apprenticeship program.
With the support of this fellowship, Tina visited Wesleyan University in the United States to learn about their apprenticeship program, bringing valuable insights to develop UCR's version of the program.

We are grateful for the eScience Center's continued support of the Data Center's mission, and look forward to an exciting year. Stay tuned for more updates on our upcoming activities and events!
