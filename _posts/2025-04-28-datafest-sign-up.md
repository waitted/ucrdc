# DataFest 2025 

May 26, students from HZ University of Applied Sciences and University College Roosevelt face new challenges during Datafest 2025: Data for Freedom. 
 
Students will explore innovative solutions with respect to cultural heritage in Zeeland. “Freedom cannot be taken for granted.” That’s what the 80 Years of Freedom Zeeland Foundation tells us. “In 1945 we regained our freedom. But in other countries war is still being waged to this day. We, the 80 Years of Freedom Zeeland Foundation, want to build a future together in which 80 years of freedom is not just a memory, but is firmly anchored for the future. Join us and contribute to the preservation of peace and freedom. For today and forever!” 

# Focus on storytelling

The preservation of peace and freedom. Isn’t that a great theme to derive our challenge? During Data for Freedom students will work with various data sources with respect Zeeland’s cultural heritage. 
The focus is on storytelling using these data sources. The students process their findings in interactive visualizations. This can only be successful if relations between objects in (different) collections are properly identified. To this end the students have to come up with creative solutions for both data preparation tasks, as well as clustering and classification models. To this end several very specific assignments are available.
