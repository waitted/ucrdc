The UCR Data Center is pleased to announce its office hours for the upcoming semester, running from Week 4 to Week 15. 
Students are encouraged to drop by for assistance with data science related questions, whether for a data encounter in a course, another UCR course, or your SEPR. 
No appointment is necessary. 

The weekly schedule is published on the [Data Center website](https://ucrdatacenter.github.io/contact/). 
Any updates or (temporary) changes to the schedule will be shared on the same page. 
All office hours are held in the Data Centerâ€™s office, located on the ground floor of Anne. 

For more information or to request an individual consultation, please email [datacenter@ucr.nl](mailto:datacenter@ucr.nl).

We hope to see many of you at the office hours!
