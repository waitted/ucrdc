# Learning outcomes

In this tutorial you learn the steps needed to create basic figures in R. You will need these skills in the poster and presentation assignments in the course.

You learn how to find and import data into R, how to clean the data that you need, and how to make basic figures using the `ggplot2` package.

# First steps

This tutorial assumes that you have already installed R and RStudio. If you have not done so yet, please follow [this installation tutorial](https://ucrdatacenter.github.io/tutorial/r_install.html).

Before you proceed, read and follow along sections 2.3-2.5, 3.1-3.4, and 4-6 of [A (very) short introduction to R](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/A%20(very)%20short%20introduction%20to%20R.pdf).

In addition, create a new project for the Macroeconomics course, and install the `tidyverse` package, as explained [here](https://ucrdatacenter.github.io/tutorial/r_basics.html).

In each section of this tutorial you will find videos guiding you through the processes explained in the text. You should first read the relevant section as an introduction to the contents, then watch and follow along with the video presenting the steps in more detail.

If you have any questions after watching a video, check the help files of functions (access by running `?functionname`), look at more extensive [Data Center tutorials](https://ucrdatacenter.github.io/tutorial), try googling your question, or email [datacenter\@ucr.nl](mailto:datacenter@ucr.nl) to attend office hours. The code shown in the videos is available on [Github](https://github.com/ucrdatacenter/projects/blob/main/SSCECON207/2023h1/workshop1code.R).

# Finding and importing data

## Finding the right data

Once you have a research question or topic you would like to look into, you need to determine what data you need: establish a list of the indicators and countries, and the time period. Once you know what you're looking for, you can search for a source.

For macroeconomic indicators reliable data sources are the [World Bank Databank](https://data.worldbank.org/) and the [OECD database](https://data.oecd.org/). In addition, you can find a more extensive list of data sources [here](https://ucrdatacenter.github.io/tutorial/data.html).

In the following we will work with GDP data from OECD ([link](https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm)) and CO2 emissions data from the World Bank ([link](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC)).

Before importing data to R, you need to download it to your computer and save it in your project folder.

## Importing a CSV file

CSV files are a convenient and simple way of storing data. CSV stands for "comma-separated values": the raw data is text file where each line of text is a row of data, and values within a row are separated by commas. In most cases your computer will automatically open CSV files in Excel, where they are displayed as a table. CSV files are the most common and also one of the easiest to import to R.

In order to import a CSV file to R, open your project in RStudio. In the top left corner of RStudio find and click *File*$\to$*Import dataset*$\to$*From Text (readr)*. In the data import pop-up window click "Browse" and find the GDP data that you moved to your project folder. RStudio will try to automatically detect the format of your data: the result of that is shown in the Data preview window. If something looks wrong, try changing some of the settings below the data preview until the preview looks correct. Additionally, you should change the name of the data to something sensible, e.g. `GDP`. Once all the settings are ready, you can copy the contents of the "Code preview" window into your script, and use it to import your data. As long as you start your script by loading the `tidyverse` library, you don't need to copy `library(readr)`, as `readr` is a part of `tidyverse`.

## Importing an Excel file

Importing an Excel file follows the same process as a CSV file, but you should choose *From Excel* instead of *From Text (readr)* when importing the dataset. Every following step is the same, except that you do need to load the `readxl` package separately, as it is not a part of `tidyverse`.

## Other data formats

If you are interested, more information on importing files with other data formats, and writing your own import code are shown in [this tutorial](https://ucrdatacenter.github.io/tutorial/r_adv_import.html).

# Data cleaning and manipulation

## Establishing the data cleaning steps

Data files downloaded from online sources are not always in a convenient format for analysis in R: variable names are not always intuitive or consistent, you might need to make some additional calculations, recode variables, or remove some variables/observations. You can make a list of steps you need to take by observing the structure of your data.

You can view your data with the function `View(dataname)`, while the output of `summary(dataname)` shows you all the variables you have, including their type and some details about their content. In case you need more information about what your variables mean, you can look at the documentation on website of your data source.

A useful tool to keep in mind when planning your data cleaning is the pipe operator `%>%` (keyboard shortcut: Ctrl/Command+Shift+M). Using it in a workflow means that the next function uses the previous result as an input, and helps you work in a linear fashion. E.g. "first I need to filter observations for the Netherlands, then I need to use the resulting dataset to calculate GDP growth rates".

## Selecting and renaming variables

Often you don't need all variables included in your downloaded dataset. Then you can select the subset of variables you need (or the subset you would like to remove). The function for doing so is `select()`, and the arguments of the function are your dataset, followed by the names of the variables you would like to keep (or remove, if the variable names are preceded by `-`). The following examples show how to use the function with and without the pipe operator.

```{r}
# keep only variables x and y
select(data, x, y)

# remove variables x and y
data %>% 
  select(-x, -y)
```

Especially if you want to combine datasets from different sources, you may want variable names to be consistent across datasets or convenient to work with. This problem can be easily fixed using the `rename()` function, which has the format `rename(data, "new_name" = "old_name")`

## Filtering observations

Often you only need a subset of your data, e.g. observations from a particular country or after a given year. You can filter your dataset using the `filter()` function and logical expressions (e.g. keep if the value for the variable year is greater than 2000, or keep if the value for the variable country is "Netherlands"). You need to use the logical operators: `==` means equal to, `!=` means not equal to, `>=,<=,>,<` define comparisons, `%in%` means "is one of", and you can combine multiple expressions with AND `&` and OR `|`. If the result of the test is true, the `filter()` function keeps the observation, and if the result is false, the observation is removed. For instance, to filter for Dutch or Belgian observations between the years 2000 and 2020:

```{r}
data %>% 
  filter((country == "Netherlands" | country == "Belgium") & year >= 2000 & year <= 2020)
```

## Creating new variables

In some cases you might need to do additional calculations with your data. For example you may want to calculate GDP growth rates from annual GDP observations, calculate averages over time, or treat a number as a character string. Helpful functions in this case are the following:

-   `mutate()`: to create new variables (or modify existing variables) using functions or calculations - think of it as adding a new column to your data frame.
-   `summarize()`: to create new variables using functions, using all rows from your data frame (or from a part of your data frame) - think e.g. if you have a data frame of GDP data from 20 years, and you want to calculate the average value of GDP in this dataset.
-   `group_by()`: to specify grouping variables before using `mutate()` or `summarize()` - think e.g. if you have GDP data from 20 years from two countries, and you want to calculate average GDP over time separately for the two countries.

## Long and wide format

Compare the following two simple datasets:

Data A:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
test <- tibble(
  year = rep(c(2022, 2023), each = 2),
  country = rep(c("countryA", "countryB"), times = 2),
  value = c(10, 12, 14, 15)
)
knitr::kable(test) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```

Data B:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
test %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = country, values_from = value) %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```

Data A is in long format, and Data B is in wide format. The tables contain the same information, but sometimes one format is more convenient than the other.

You can convert between these two forms using the `pivot_longer()` (wide to long) and `pivot_wider()` (long to wide) functions. To use `pivot_longer()` you need to specify which columns you'd like to turn into a single column: e.g. to go from Data B to Data A, you'd use the argument `cols = c(countryA, countryB)` (or equivalently, `cols = -year`). To use `pivot_wider()`, you need to specify which column to use for variable names, and which column for variable values: going from Data A to Data B would use the arguments `names_from = country, values_from = value`.

## Merging datasets

If you want to work with variables from multiple dataframes (e.g. plotting them on the same plot), you need to combine those dataframes.

There are multiple ways to combine data frames. The simplest is row-binding: there you take two data frames that have the same variables, and basically place one below the other. You can then use the `bind_rows()` function, with the argument listing the dataframes to combine.

However, most of the time you need something more complicated than row-binding. E.g. if in both dataframes your entities are defined by the country and the year, you want to match up the observations so that each row contains data from only one country-year combination. If your identifying variables have the same names in both datasets, you can replace the `bind_rows()` function with `full_join()` and specify the dataframes to combine as the argument in the same way.

# First `ggplot` figures

`ggplot` is a powerful R package for creating figures. Figures made with `ggplot` are built from several layers. You always use the same basic code structure to create a wide range of figures:

1.  The `ggplot()` function creates a blank canvas for you to work on.
2.  Geoms add the visual elements, such as points, lines, bars, or other shapes.
3.  Other specifications can include changing axis settings, setting the theme, adding labels, etc.
4.  You connect all these different specifications to each other using `+` signs.

The variables that you want to display on the graph must always be wrapped in an `aes()` function, which stands for aesthetics. This specification tells R to determine the value of the aesthetic (x and y axes, colors, groups, line types, etc.) based on the value of the variable. `aes()` can be specified both in the main `ggplot()` function (in which case it will apply to all geoms) or within a `geom_...()` function (then it only applies to that geom).

For line charts you use `geom_line()`, and for scatterplots `geom_point()`. You can fit a line on your scatterplot with `geom_smooth()`. If you want to fit a straight line, add `method = "lm"` as an argument inside `geom_smooth()`.

If you want to change the color of a point/line based on the value of a variable, specify `color = variable` **inside** the `aes()` function. If you would like all points/lines to be a particular color, specify `color = "blue"` **outside** the `aes()` function but still inside the geom you'd like to modify. Each geom's help file lists all characteristics that you can modify.

Once you have a base plot, you can change the title and axis labels (always make sure to use clear labels!). Once you're happy with your plot, you can save it in your project folder by using `ggsave("filename.jpg")`. This function saves the last plot you created, and you can also use other file formats such as .png or .pdf.

If you would like to see more ways of plotting with `ggplot`, check out the [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) or some of the other useful links [here](https://ucrdatacenter.github.io/tutorial/r_basics.html#Help_with_ggplot). Sections 1-4 of [How to make any plot in ggplot2?](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html#6.1%20Make%20a%20time%20series%20plot%20(using%20ggfortify)) give particularly good explanations for beginners.
