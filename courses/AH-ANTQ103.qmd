# Introduction

This page collects materials for the data-driven assignments in the Spring 2025 edition of Introduction to Archeology at UCR. You can also access the related files (data and R scripts) directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/ucrdatacenter/projects/tree/main/AH-ANTQ103/2025h1).

# Office hours

The Data Center offers office hours to help you with the data-driven assignments. You can find more information about the schedule [here](../../contact.qmd).

# Preparation for Data Center workshops

To participate in the workshops, you will need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer. If you donâ€™t have these programs installed, please follow [this installation tutorial](../../tutorials/r_install.qmd).

In addition, the [R basics tutorial](../../../tutorials/r_basics.qmd) on the Data Center website explains the RStudio interface, and shows how to create a new project and how to install packages.
