## Call for proposals {#call-for-proposals}

We are pleased to invite applications for the UCR Data Center Apprenticeship Program. This initiative falls under the Data Science and AI theme and aims to support faculty and staff in integrating the tools of data science and AI in their teaching, research, and administrative processes.

During the Apprenticeship Program, you will guide a student working on a project. The Data Center will offer training in the tools of data science and AI relevant for this project and support the student through individual consultations. Participating students will receive credits in the form of an Academic Internship.

The program has an intensive period of two weeks from January 13 to January 24, 2025. During these weeks, the students receive relevant training in the mornings and work on the project in the afternoons. (You too are welcome to attend the morning workshops.) Please be available during this period (at least two days a week) to guide your supervisee. This part of the program ends with a poster presentation on January 24, 2025. The poster presentation is intended as a presentation of work in progress. You can find the presentations prepared during the first Apprenticeship Program and read more about the workshops we offer on our [website](../). The projects are finished in the following semester; the details depend on the nature of the project.

We invite proposals for a variety of projects. The projects the Data Center has most experience with involve introducing data encounters in courses. Data encounters represent learning activities (big and small) in which students use the tools of data science in the context of their discipline. The center supports the development of these activities (e.g., prepares data and code), runs workshops, and holds office hours for students. You can find many examples from past UCR courses on our website. If you would like to introduce such a data encounter in your course, please apply.

Another type of projects we have experience with concerns UCR's marketing and recruitment efforts. We hear many ideas on how we could excite prospective students about building their own program. Here is one example that involves the tools of data science (scroll down to the interactive chord diagram). If you have an idea of this variety, please apply.

Finally, we also welcome projects in which students support faculty in their research, as well as other projects we have not thought of.

Please email your proposal by November 18, 2024, to [Datacenter\@ucr.nl](mailto:Datacenter@ucr.nl){.email}. To qualify, the project should support faculty or staff in integrating the tools of data science and AI in their teaching, research, and administrative processes. We plan to accept all projects that qualify. We notify you of whether your project is accepted by December 1, 2024. If you would like to discuss your ideas with us before applying, you are welcome to.

The application form (at the bottom of this call) asks you for a name of the student you would like to work with. Please talk to the student before nominating them to make sure they agree to participate in the program. When selecting a student please consider whether they have the background knowledge needed for the project. For example, if the project concerns introducing a data encounter in a course, ideally, the student would have already taken that course, or at least some course in the track. With respect to data science skills, prior experience is desirable but not necessary; students can pick up these skills during the program (unless you aim for something very advanced; if so, let us know).

We look forward to receiving your applications!
