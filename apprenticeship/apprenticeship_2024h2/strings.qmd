To learn about how to handle character strings using regular expressions, we follow the case study in Chapter 17.1-17.7 of "Introduction to Data Science" by Rafael A. Irizarry.

The tutorial works with a dataset of self-reported heights, and covers both the most important functions for handling strings in R (with the `stringr` package) and the basics of describing patterns in strings with regular expressions.

Please use [this link](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook-part-1/wrangling/string-processing.html) to follow the tutorial.

In addition, [this cheatsheet](https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf) provides a brief summary of the key functions and regex patterns.
