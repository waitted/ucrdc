Compare your own output to what you see printed below to make sure all of your code runs as expected.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn some cases you might need to summarize your data -- that is, collapse a lot of information into a few key statistics-- to understand it better and to compare different groups. In this tutorial, we show you how to summarize data within groups using the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions from `tidyverse` functions and the `diamonds` dataset (which comes pre-loaded with `tidyverse` so you don't need to import it).\n\nLet's load the `tidyverse` package and have a look at the `diamonds` dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load tidyverse\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# add diamonds to the environment\ndata(diamonds)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Default summary\n\nThe `summary()` function provides a quick overview of the data, printed in the console. For numeric variables, it shows the minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, maximum, and the number of missing values. Let's use the `summary()` function to get an overview of the `diamonds` dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# get a summary of the diamonds dataset\nsummary(diamonds)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     carat               cut        color        clarity          depth      \n Min.   :0.2000   Fair     : 1610   D: 6775   SI1    :13065   Min.   :43.00  \n 1st Qu.:0.4000   Good     : 4906   E: 9797   VS2    :12258   1st Qu.:61.00  \n Median :0.7000   Very Good:12082   F: 9542   SI2    : 9194   Median :61.80  \n Mean   :0.7979   Premium  :13791   G:11292   VS1    : 8171   Mean   :61.75  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0400   Ideal    :21551   H: 8304   VVS2   : 5066   3rd Qu.:62.50  \n Max.   :5.0100                     I: 5422   VVS1   : 3655   Max.   :79.00  \n                                    J: 2808   (Other): 2531                  \n     table           price             x                y         \n Min.   :43.00   Min.   :  326   Min.   : 0.000   Min.   : 0.000  \n 1st Qu.:56.00   1st Qu.:  950   1st Qu.: 4.710   1st Qu.: 4.720  \n Median :57.00   Median : 2401   Median : 5.700   Median : 5.710  \n Mean   :57.46   Mean   : 3933   Mean   : 5.731   Mean   : 5.735  \n 3rd Qu.:59.00   3rd Qu.: 5324   3rd Qu.: 6.540   3rd Qu.: 6.540  \n Max.   :95.00   Max.   :18823   Max.   :10.740   Max.   :58.900  \n                                                                  \n       z         \n Min.   : 0.000  \n 1st Qu.: 2.910  \n Median : 3.530  \n Mean   : 3.539  \n 3rd Qu.: 4.040  \n Max.   :31.800  \n                 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Summarizing the data\n\nThe `summarize()` function can produce the same summary statistics as the `summary()` function and more, and it allows you to save the results to a new dataset. The `summarize()` function uses the argument structure `summarize(data, variable = expression)` where `data` is the dataset you want to summarize, `variable` is the name of the new variable, and `expression` is the calculation you want to perform. (Note that it has the same argument structure as the `mutate()` function for creating new variables. The difference is that `mutate()` calculates one value per observation and `summarize()` calculates one value for the whole dataset.)\n\nFor example, let's calculate the mean price of diamonds:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# calculate the mean price of diamonds\nsummarize(diamonds, mean_price = mean(price))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  mean_price\n       <dbl>\n1      3933.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can also calculate multiple summary statistics at once by separating them with a comma (and as a good practice, a new line).\n\nLet's calculate the mean price and the number of observations in the dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# calculate the mean price and the number of observations\nsummarize(diamonds,\n          mean_price = mean(price),\n          n = n())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  mean_price     n\n       <dbl> <int>\n1      3933. 53940\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo be able to work with this new dataset, you need to save it to a new object. Let's assign the result of the `summarize()` function to a new object called `diamonds_summary`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# save the result to a new object\ndiamonds_summary <- summarize(diamonds,\n                              mean_price = mean(price),\n                              n = n())\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Summarizing data within groups\n\nThe `group_by()` function is used to group the data by one or more variables. Then summary statistics can be calculated within each group using the `summarize()` function in the same way as before. This is useful when you want to compare different groups in your data, for example the mean price of diamonds by cut.\n\nNote that the following code uses the pipe operator `|>` to chain the functions together. The pipe operator is used to pass the output of one function as the first input to the next function, making the code more readable. To read more about the pipe operator, see the tutorial on the [tidy workflow](../r_intro_workflow).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# start with the diamonds tibble\ndiamonds |> \n  # group by cut\n  group_by(cut) |> \n  # calculate the mean price within each group\n  summarize(mean_price = mean(price))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  cut       mean_price\n  <ord>          <dbl>\n1 Fair           4359.\n2 Good           3929.\n3 Very Good      3982.\n4 Premium        4584.\n5 Ideal          3458.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<!-- ## Video tutorial TBA -->\n",
