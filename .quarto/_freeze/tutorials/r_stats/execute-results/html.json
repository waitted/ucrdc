There are a few packages available for generating simple summary statistics tables that contain information about the central tendencies and dispersion of the data that also export nicely, such as `gtsummary`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(gtsummary)\n\n# tbl_summary() creates a summary table of the data\ntbl_summary(diamonds)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can stratify your summary by a grouping variable using the `by` argument:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntbl_summary(diamonds, by = cut)\n\n# add p-value of difference between groups\ntbl_summary(diamonds, by = cut) |> \n  add_p()\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can also customize the appearance of the table.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntbl_summary(diamonds, by = cut) |> \n  modify_header(label ~ \"Variable\") |> \n  modify_caption(\"Summary Table by Cut\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo export the table as a Word document, use the `gtsave()` function. Note that we first use the `as_gt()` function to convert the `tbl_summary()` output to a `gt` object, and load the `gt` package in order to use the Word export function defined for the `gt` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(gt)\n\ntbl_summary(diamonds, by = cut) |> \n  as_gt() |> \n  gtsave(\"summary_table.docx\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you use LaTeX, you can also export as a LaTeX table, also relying on the `gt` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntbl_summary(diamonds, by = cut) |> \n  as_gt() |> \n  gtsave(\"summary_table.tex\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Hypothesis testing\n\nMost of the simple statistical tests are from base R, so they don't rely on tidy principles, but many are compatible with tidy workflows to at least some extent. In the following we'll cover some of the key methods that show up in methods and statistics courses at UCR. In addition, the `tidy()` function from the `broom` package converts most text output into simple tibbles, which are useful for exporting and visualizing results.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(broom)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## t-tests\n\nWe can run one and two samples t-tests to evaluate group means with the `t.test()` function. The function supports various options and model specifications: a simple one-sample t-test only requires specifying the variable of interest, either with `x = data$variable` or `x = variable, data = data` syntax. For two-sample t-tests, we can use the formula syntax `y ~ x` to specify the dependent and independent variables or the `x` and `y` (and optionally `data`) arguments. Additional options include specifying the alternative hypothesis, the confidence level, the value of $\\mu$, and whether we want a paired t-test and assume equal variances. Helper functions such as `tidy()` convert the Console output to an easy-to-export tibble of results.\n\nTo demonstrate two-sample t-tests, we define a subset of the data that contains only two possible values of `cut`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# simple t-test (H0: mean=mu)\nt.test(diamonds$carat, mu = 1)\n\n# define data subsample of fair and good diamonds to have only two groups of cut\ndiamonds_sub <- diamonds |> \n  filter(cut %in% c(\"Fair\", \"Good\"))\n\n# can also use data argument instead of data$...\n# price ~ cut is formula specification: variable ~ group\n# H0: fair and good diamonds have the same average price\nt.test(price ~ cut, alternative = \"greater\", data = diamonds_sub)\n\n# tidy() function turns results into a tibble\nt.test(price ~ cut, alternative = \"greater\", data = diamonds_sub) |> tidy()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Correlation test\n\nThe `cor.test()` function calculates the correlation between two variables. Again, the function supports various specifications: `x` and `y` arguments, formula syntax (see below for an example), and the `data` argument.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncor.test( ~ price + carat, data = diamonds)\n\n# tidy() function turns results into a tibble\ncor.test( ~ price + carat, data = diamonds) |> tidy()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Simple regression\n\nA key building block of statistical analysis is linear regression. The `lm()` function fits a linear model to the data, with a wide range of specifications, passed as the formula argument (first argument if unnamed). The formula syntax is `y ~ x`, where `y` is the dependent variable and `x` is the independent variable. Again, optional function arguments allow for a lot of customization, but the default settings are sufficient for most applications. Helper functions such as `tidy()` and `summary()` provide extensive summaries of the model fit and coefficients, and `tbl_regression()` from the `gtsummary` package creates neat tables of the results. Assigning the result of a model to an object saves computational time, as then we can work with the results without having to re-run the analysis every time.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# assign outcome to object\nfit <- lm(price ~ carat, data = diamonds)\n\n# extensive result summary\nfit |> summary()\n\n# tidy coefficients\nfit |> tidy()\n\n# display-ready table with gtsummary\ntbl_regression(fit)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Multiple regression\n\nMultiple regression extends simple regression to multiple independent variables. The only difference is the formula specification, which now connects multiple independent variables with `+` signs. The formula specification also allows for interactions between variables, which can be specified with `*` (if the main effects should be included) or `:` (for only the interaction term). The `DV ~ .~` syntax includes all variables in the data except the dependent variable as independent variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm(price ~ x + y + z + table + depth, data = diamonds) |> summary()\n\n# all variables in data\nlm(price ~ ., data = diamonds) |> summary()\n\n# interactions\nlm(price ~ x * y, data = diamonds) |> summary()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## ANOVA\n\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) is a generalization of the t-test to multiple groups. The `aov()` function fits an ANOVA model to the data, with the formula syntax `y ~ x`, where `y` is the dependent variable and `x` is the independent variable. The same helper functions as with `lm()` can be used to summarize the results.\n\nNote that ANOVA is a specific case of a linear regression model, so the results are equivalent to those of a linear regression model with a categorical independent variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nanova_fit <- aov(price ~ cut, data = diamonds)\n\nsummary(anova_fit)\ntidy(anova_fit)\n\n# equivalent regression\nlm(price ~ cut, data = diamonds) |> summary()\n```\n:::\n",
