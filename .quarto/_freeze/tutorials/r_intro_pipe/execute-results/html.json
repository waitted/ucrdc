Compare your own output to what you see printed below to make sure all of your code runs as expected.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial, we introduce you to the tidy workflow, a set of principles and tools that help you work with data in a structured and efficient way. This workflow allows you to combine different steps of the data cleaning process into a single pipeline, making your code more readable and easier to maintain.\n\nThis tutorial shows you an example of how to use the tidy workflow on the `diamonds` dataset, which comes pre-loaded with the `tidyverse` package.\n\nLet's load the `tidyverse` package and have a look at the `diamonds` dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load tidyverse\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# add diamonds to the environment\ndata(diamonds)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Establishing the data cleaning steps\n\nData files downloaded from online sources are not always in a convenient format for analysis in R: variable names are not always intuitive or consistent, you might need to make some additional calculations, recode variables, or remove some variables/observations. You can make a list of steps you need to take by observing the structure of your data.\n\nYou can view your data with the function `View(dataname)`, while the output of `summary(dataname)` shows you all the variables you have, including their type and some details about their content. In case you need more information about what your variables mean, you can look at the documentation on website of your data source (or the help file if you use data from a package).\n\nOur goal now is to look at only Ideal cut diamonds and compare the carat and price of these diamonds.\n\n## The tidy workflow\n\nA useful tool to keep in mind when planning your data cleaning is the pipe operator `|>` (keyboard shortcut: Ctrl/Command+Shift+M). The base pipe operator `|>` does the same as the tidyverse pipe operator `%>%` -- you can use either one.\n\nUsing it in a workflow means that the next function uses the previous result as an input, and helps you work in a linear fashion. E.g. \"first I need to take the diamonds tibble and filter observations for which the cut is Ideal, then I need to select only the carat and price variables, and then I need to calculate the price per carat\".\n\nTo work with the result of the pipeline, you can assign it to a new object, e.g. `diamonds_new`. The `filter()`, `select()`, and `mutate()` functions are data cleaning functions from `tidyverse`, introduced in other tutorials ([`filter` and `select`](../r_intro_subset); [`mutate`](../r_intro_mutate)), which all take the input dataset as the first argument that we replace with the pipe here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# start with the diamonds tibble\ndiamonds_new <- diamonds |>\n  # filter the data for Ideal cut diamonds\n  filter(cut == \"Ideal\") |>\n  # select only the carat and price variables\n  select(carat, price) |>\n  # calculate the price per carat\n  mutate(price_per_carat = price / carat)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis code is equivalent to the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create a new object with the filtered data\ndiamonds_ideal <- filter(diamonds, cut == \"Ideal\")\n\n# select only the carat and price variables\ndiamonds_selected <- select(diamonds_ideal, carat, price)\n\n# calculate the price per carat\ndiamonds_new <- mutate(diamonds_selected, price_per_carat = price / carat)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe tidy workflow allows you to combine these steps into a single pipeline, so you don't need to create intermediate objects.\n\n<!-- ## Video tutorial TBA -->\n",
