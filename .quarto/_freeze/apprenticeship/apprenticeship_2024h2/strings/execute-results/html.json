Irizarry.\n\nThe tutorial works with a dataset of self-reported heights, and covers both the most important functions for handling strings in R (with the `stringr` package) and the basics of describing patterns in strings with regular expressions.\n\nPlease use [this link](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook-part-1/wrangling/string-processing.html) to follow the tutorial.\n\nIn addition, [this cheatsheet](https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf) provides a brief summary of the key functions and regex patterns.\n",
