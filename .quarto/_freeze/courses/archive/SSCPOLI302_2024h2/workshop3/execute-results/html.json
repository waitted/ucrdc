Below is a template for the analysis using for the dossier 2022/0396(COD), which is regulating packaging and packaging waste. Our cleaned data is stored in our project directory and is called \"2022_0396_COD_clean.xlsx\".\n\nIn this first code chunk, you only need to change the file name and the dossier reference (see comments) to match your data. This code will load the meeting data, filter it for the dossier of interest, load the cleaned list of attendees, and combine the two datasets. So in the data we will have not only the meetings related to the dossier 2022/0396(COD) as declared in the original data, but also the standardized attendee names and categories.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load the necessary libraries (install if needed)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rio)\n\n# import meeting data\nmeetings_raw <- import(\"https://github.com/ucrdatacenter/projects/raw/main/SSCPOLI302/2024h2/meetings_per_attendee.xlsx\", setclass = \"tbl_df\") |>\n  mutate(meeting_date = as.Date(meeting_date)) |>\n  drop_na(procedure_reference)\n\n# import attendee data from packaging waste file\nattendees <- import(\"https://github.com/ucrdatacenter/projects/raw/main/SSCPOLI302/2024h2/attendees/2022_0396_COD_clean.xlsx\", setclass = \"tbl_df\")\n# import your own data from the file you copied into your Project Folder\n# attendees <- import(\"YourFileName.xlsx\", setclass = \"tbl_df\")\n\n# retain data for your dossier, then merge with attendee data\nmeetings <- meetings_raw |>\n  filter(procedure_reference == \"2022/0396(COD)\") |>\n  left_join(attendees, by = \"attendees\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo help make our figures, we can define some additional political groups characteristics. We will use this information to color our plots and to order the political groups in the plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# assigning colors and names\nseats <- tribble(\n
