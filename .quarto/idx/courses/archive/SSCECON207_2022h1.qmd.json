RStudio is a development environment that makes working with R much more convenient. Both are free to download and install.\n\nTo download R, go to [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and follow the instructions on the page. To download RStudio, go to [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), scroll down and download the file recommended for your operating system.\n\nWhen installing, you can always stick to the default settings, unless you have different preferences.\n\nIn case you get stuck at any point, or would like more guidance in the installation process, feel free to check out any of the following links:\n\n-   [Tutorial: Getting Started with R and RStudio](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/tutorial-getting-started-with-r-and-rstudio/)\n-   [R Tutorial: How to install R and R studio (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Qu7Jg1Jw5A)\n\n# Assignments\n\n## Timeline\n\n-   The first Data Center workshop takes place in week 2. It covers the basics of how to create figures in R. You should make sure to have R and RStudio installed before this workshop, and read sections 2, 3.1-3.4, and 4-6 of [A (very) short introduction to R](https://github.com/ClaudiaBrauer/A-very-short-introduction-to-R/blob/master/documents/A%20(very)%20short%20introduction%20to%20R.pdf) and sections 1-4 of [How to make any plot in ggplot2?](http://r-statistics.co/ggplot2-Tutorial-With-R.html#6.1%20Make%20a%20time%20series%20plot%20(using%20ggfortify)).\n-   The IS-LM poster assignment is due in week 4 of the semester.\n-   The second Data Center workshop takes place in week 7. It builds on your existing R skills, with a focus on finding and cleaning data.\n-   The final empirical paper is due at the end of week 15.\n-   The Data Center student fellows hold office hours every Wednesday between 15:00-19:00 (15:00-17:00 with Tina, 17:00-19:00 with Bianka) in the Data Center's office (Anne 1.30 - first floor) to answer questions and help with the poster and paper assignments. Feel free to email Tina ([datacenter\\@ucr.nl](mailto:datacenter@ucr.nl){.email}) to schedule an individual consultation outside of office hours or to attend office hours. In case you would like to make use of the in-person office hours, please email the Data Center at least two hours in advance.\n\n## IS-LM poster\n\n### Guidelines\n\nThe assignment guidelines and the grading rubric are on Moodle.\n\n### Workshop handout\n\nThe materials covered in the first Data Center workshop, including both code and explanations, can be found [here](SSCECON207_2022h1/workshop1.html).\n\n### Supporting materials\n\n#### The basics of R\n\n-   [Cheat sheet for importing data](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-import.pdf)\n-   [Cheat sheet for data manipulation](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-transformation.pdf) (including `filter()`, `select()` and the pipe operator(`%>%`))\n-   [Cheat sheet for data tidying](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/tidyr.pdf) (including reshaping and pivoting)\n-   [Getting started with Data in R](https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html#getting-started) (covers: using R and RStudio, basic terminology, introduction to packages)\n-   [R objects](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/r-objects.html)\n-   [Advice on using projects](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)\n-   [Full tutorial on R language basics (slides)](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/04-rlang/04-rlang.html#1)\n-   [Full tutorial on data cleaning and wrangling (slides)](https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/05-tidyverse/05-tidyverse.html#1)\n-   [More explanation on the pipe operator](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html)\n-   [Selecting and filtering data](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-dataI.html#sec:pipe)\n-   [Conversions between long and wide format](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-dataII.html#data-verbs-for-converting-wide-to-narrow-and-vice-versa)\n-   [Creating a project in RStudio (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyrJmJWgPiU)\n-   [Packages in R (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6VygIgvoZU&t=1s)\n-   [Loading a data file (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MVolYETR5Q)\n-   [Data manipulation (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc_ufg4uW4U)\n\n#### Help with `ggplot`\n\n-   [Cheat sheet for `ggplot`](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)\n-   [The R Graph Gallery (example plots, including full R scripts)](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/)\n-   [More details on data visualization](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-vizII.html#a-grammar-for-data-graphics)\n-   [Saving plots with `ggsave()`](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/save-r-ggplot-using-ggsave/)\n-   [Basic `ggplot` tutorial (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr2X7rmkprM)\n-   [Customizing plots (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GmQ5BdAhG4)\n\n#### Data sources used\n\n-   GDP: [World Bank DataBank: GDP (constant LCU)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KN)\n-   Consumption: [World Bank DataBank: Final consumption expenditure (constant LCU)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.TOTL.KN)\n-   Investment: [World Bank DataBank: Gross fixed capital formation (constant LCU)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.GDI.FTOT.KN)\n-   Government spending: [World Bank DataBank: General government final consumption expenditure (constant LCU)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.GOVT.KN)\n-   Interest rate: [World Bank DataBank: Real interest rate (%)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FR.INR.RINR)\n-   Inflation rate: [World Bank DataBank: Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG)\n\n## Empirical paper on growth\n\n### Guidelines\n\nThe assignment guidelines and the grading rubric are on Moodle.\n\nYou can find an example paper [here](https://github.com/ucrdatacenter/projects/raw/main/SSCECON207/2022h1/workshop%202/example%20paper.pdf).\n\n### Workshop handout\n\nThe materials covered in the second Data Center workshop, including both code and explanations, can be found [here](SSCECON207_2022h1/workshop2.html).\n\n### Supporting materials\n\n#### Inspiration for your research question\n\n-   [Growthecon](https://growthecon.com/topics/): collections of materials related to various themes related to growth\n-   [Conversable Economist](https://conversableeconomist.wpcomstaging.com/): blog connecting current issues to economics\n-   [The Economy textbook](https://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/0-3-contents.html): undergraduate textbook with a focus on growth from multiple aspects.
