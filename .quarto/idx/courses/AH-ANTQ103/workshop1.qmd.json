Navigating R studio","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE)\n```\n\n\nAt this point, we have installed R and RStudio, opened this file, and are now met by four panels within the R interface.\n\nThe panel in the upper left corner, in which you read this file, is the source panel, where you write your code. Beneath that is the console, where the code is executed. We can also write code in this panel, but for convenience we will always use R Scripts placed in the source panel. At the top right, there is the environment panel. It contains an overview of all data that R has stored in its memory. While we work, this panel will fill up will all kinds of data that you create and save. Lastly, in the lower right corner we have a panel for navigating files, plots, help documents, and more useful things.\n\nR can be used for many things, for example as a basic calculator. Try the following operations. The output will be printed in the console (below). Please note that adding spaces between the numbers and the operators is not necessary, but it makes the code more readable.\n\n```{r navigating, eval=FALSE}\n1 + 1\n1 - 1\n2 * 3\n4 / 2\n2 ^ 3\n```\n\n## 2. Data types\n\nIn R we have different types of data that we should be aware of. The most important ones for archaeologists are numbers, typically called a double (`dbl`) and text data, represented by a so called string of characters (`chr`). Whilst there are others, we will only focus on these two for now.\n\n## 3. Variables\n\nOftentimes we want to use a specific value of data later on again, in which case you can easily assign variables to values in R. Try the following operations. After running the code by clicking the green triangle in the upper right corner of the grey box below, these variables should be added to the environment panel. Now try assigning a value to a variable yourself.\n\nNote that the arrow can be typed by pressing Alt + -, as well as by typing \\<- manually.\n\n```{r variables, eval=FALSE}\na <- 1\nb <- 5\nc <- \"Word\"\nd <- \"This is a whole sentence\"\n```\n\nWe can now also use our variables in the calculations instead of the numbers. Try the following operations.\n\n```{r variables2, eval=FALSE}\na + b\na - b\na * b\na / b\na ^ b\n```\n\nHowever, we should not be able to add these two variables together, since we defined them as text data, and R does not know how to add two strings together\n\n```{r variables3, eval=FALSE}\nc + d\n```\n\n## 4. Vectors\n\nNext to variables, we will often encounter vectors, which can be described as groups of values and which can be created with `c()`.\n\n```{r vectors, eval=FALSE}\nx <- c(21, 23, 20, 23)\ny <- c(\"Paul\", \"John\", \"George\", \"Ringo\")\n```\n\n## 5. Functions\n\nWe can now do small calculations with numbers in R, but there is a lot more to do once we make use of functions! Functions can automate standard tasks such as calculating an average and thus spare you a lot of time, but they can also take over more complex tasks that we can only do thanks to the function and someone who took the time to code them.\n\nTry out the functions below on the vector we have just defined and find out what they do.\n\n```{r functions, eval=FALSE}\nmean(x)\nlength(x)\nunique(c(x, x))\n```\n\nThese are examples of very easy functions in R. Oftentimes functions require more input and information about their `arguments`, which are parts of a function that further change and define the output.\n\n## 6. Packages\n\nUp to this point, we have only installed base R, which includes basic features and functions but remains fairly limited. R packages, which are collections of elaborate functions and datasets, expand the capabilities of base R. There are packages for all kinds of disciplines, also for specific archaeological purposes like the `tesselle` packages that aim at making archaeological data science more accessible. For most purposes however, the `tidyverse` package stands out as the most essential, as it equips R for modern data science tasks. Execute the code below to install the `tidyverse` and `rio` packages, but do not worry about the latter one for now, we will come back to it later.\n\n```{r packages, eval=FALSE}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"rio\")\n```\n\nWe only have to install packages once, but we have to load them using the `library` function each time we start a new R session.\n\n```{r packages2, eval=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rio)\n```\n\nWith new packages come new functions and we can easily loose track of what each function can do. Luckily we have some guidance built right into R in the form of `helpfiles`. By typing in a question mark followed by a function, a window with useful information opens up.\n\n```{r packages3, eval=FALSE}\n?sum\n```\n\nWe can now use data structures from the tidyverse package. For example, we can create a tibble, a specialized type of data frame that you can view as a table for simplicity.\n\n```{r packages4, eval=FALSE}\ndata <- tibble(\n  name = c(\"Paul\", \"John\", \"George\", \"Ringo\"),\n  age = c(21, 23, 20, 23)\n)\n```\n\nWe then have several ways to look at the data. Try them out!\n\n```{r packages6, eval=FALSE}\nprint(data)\nView(data)\nglimpse(data)\n```\n\nIf we have a data set focussed on numeric variables, we can use the `summary` function to get a quick overview of the data.\n\n```{r packages7, eval=FALSE}\nsummary(data)\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can also try and click on our `data` in the environment panel, which automatically opens the tibble up and spares you from writing some additional code.\n\n## 7. The pipe operator\n\nThe pipe operator is a very useful operator in R. It allows us to chain together multiple operations. This makes our code more readable. It can be typed by pressing Ctrl + Shift + M, as well as by typing `|>` manually.\n\n```{r pipe, eval=FALSE}\ndata |> \n  View()\n```\n\nUsing the pipe may seem a bit counter-intuitive at the beginning. If you want to better understand how it works, think of it as putting what is in front of the pipe as the first argument into whatever follows the pipe.\n\n## 8. The `filter()` function\n\nThe `filter()` function allows us to filter rows in a tibble. This is useful for selecting a subset of the data.\n\n```{r filter, eval=FALSE}\ndata |> \n  filter(age > 20)\n```\n\nThe `filter()` function is a typical example of a function that has more than just one input:\n\nThe first argument is the tibble (Inserted here by the pipe operator). The second argument is the condition (the age must be larger than 20). The condition is a logical vector, which means that it is a vector of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values. `TRUE` means that the row is kept, and `FALSE` means that the row is removed.\n\n## 9. Comparison operators\n\nWe just used the comparison operator `>`, but there are also `<`, `==`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=` which can be used in any logical condition. Try the different operators out to see what they do!\n\n```{r operators, eval=FALSE}\nx <  21\nx == 21\nx <= 21\nx >= 21\nx != 21\n```\n\n## 10. The `select()` function\n\nThe `select()` function allows us to select columns in a tibble. This is useful for selecting a subset of the data.\n\n```{r select, eval=FALSE}\ndata |> \n  select(name)\n```\n\n## 11. The `mutate()` function\n\nThe `mutate()` function allows us to create new columns in a tibble. This is very useful for creating new variables.\n\n```{r mutate, eval=FALSE}\ndata |>\n  mutate(age_squared = age ^ 2)\n```\n\nNote that we have seen the use of both `==` and `=` in different contexts. The simple `=` is often used to assign or define, like here in the mutate function, whereas `==` is strictly used as a comparison operator.\n\n## 12. NA values\n\n`NA` values are missing values. These are values that are not defined. When you want to enter a `NA` value into your data, simply type it like any other value.\n\n```{r na, eval=FALSE}\ndata <- tibble(\n  name = c(\"Paul\", \"John\", \"George\", \"Ringo\"),\n  age = c(21, NA, 20, 23)\n)\n```\n\nIf we want to know what rows contain `NA` values, we can use the `is.na()` function inside the `filter()`.\n\n```{r na2, eval=FALSE}\ndata |>\n  filter(is.na(age))\n```\n\nThis is a good example how we can combine different functions. The `is.na()` function checks the `age` column (a vector) for NA values and returns TRUE if it finds one, and FALSE if not. The `filter()` function automatically filters out all values that are not TRUE, in our example every row that does not contain a NA value for `age`.\n\nWe do not require an operational operator here, because the `is.na()` function already returns the logical condition the `filter()` requires.\n\nUsing the \"not\" operator (`!`) we could also filter rows that do not contain `NA` values.\n\n```{r na3, eval=FALSE}\ndata |> \n  filter(!is.na(age))\n```\n\n## 13. Loading external data\n\nData link [here](https://bit.ly/j_data_xlsx).\n\nThere are two main ways of loading in external data in R, either directly through a link from the internet or by storing the data in the same place as your code and then specifying the path to the file.\n\nIn both cases, we need to use the appropriate R function for the type of file that we will be loading in, so that R knows how the rows and columns are separated in the original file. In our case we want to load an Excel file from a link, so we will use the `import` function from the `rio` package we installed earlier. Try loading the data from the link using the code below. We assign our new data set the name `data`.\n\n```{r loading, eval=FALSE}\ndata <- import(\"https://bit.ly/j_data_xlsx\", setclass = \"tbl_df\")\n```\n\nThis first workshop has been quite heavy on basic Data Science in order for you to understand the basics, but you should always keep in mind how you as researchers in archaeology can use these tools to derive information useful to you.\n\n## Assignment 1\n\na)  Based on the tibble we created in step 6, create a new column called age_in_20_years. This should contain the age in 20 years.\n\nb)  Filter the tibble to only contain rows where the age in 20 years is greater than 40.\n\nc)  Display the resulting tibble.\n\n## Assignment 2\n\na)  Using the data we loaded in in step 13 about lithics from the Jerimalai rockshelter in East-Timor, create a data set that only contains rows where the `Material` is `Chert` and give it a descriptive name.\n\nb)  Create a second data set that should only contain rows using `Chalcedony` as a `Material`, also give this data set a descriptive name.\n\nc)  Which data set has more rows?\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE)\n```\n\n## 1.
