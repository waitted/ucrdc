An introduction to using GitHub for version control and collaboration. GitHub is a version control platform that allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your projects efficiently. GitHub Desktop is a graphical user interface that simplifies working with Git repositories, making it more accessible to users.\n2.  An overview of creating and using Markdown documents with Quarto for documentation and reporting. Quarto is a tool for creating documents using Markdown, enabling you to generate reports, presentations, and analyses with ease. (If you are familiar with RMarkdown, Quarto is a very similar tool with additional features.)\n\n# Working with GitHub using GitHub Desktop\n\n## Introduction to GitHub\n\nGitHub is a web-based platform designed for version control and collaboration. At its core, GitHub uses repositories (often abbreviated as \"repos\") to organize and store project files, including their full revision history. A repository acts as a central storage location where you can manage code, track changes, and collaborate with others.\n\nYou can create your own repositories, access any other public repository, and contribute to open-source projects. You can also use GitHub to track issues, manage projects, and host documentation. For example, R packages are often hosted on GitHub, making it easy for users to install and update packages directly from the platform, or view the source code.\n\nGitHub Desktop is a graphical user interface that simplifies working with GitHub repositories. It eliminates the need to use the command line, making using Git more accessible. In this section, we’ll explore the essential features of GitHub Desktop, including cloning and forking repositories, committing changes, pushing updates, and creating pull requests. These features help manage version control, ensure reproducibility, and facilitate collaboration.\n\nIn the following, we guide you through an example workflow using GitHub Desktop. This example is similar to the process you might follow if contributing to the Data Center's projects.\n\nBefore we begin, make sure that you have created a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) and installed [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) on your computer.\n\n## Creating a Repository\n\nA repository is a central location where you store your project files, track changes, and collaborate with others. When working on a project, you can create a new repository to manage your files and track changes over time.\n\nOn the GitHub home page, click the `New` button on the left hand sidebar to create a new repository. Doing so will open a new page where you can initialize the repo by entering the repository name and other details.\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"workflows_files/new_repo.png\")\n```\n\nGenerally, you'll want to create repos in your personal account (i.e. you are the owner). The repository name should be descriptive and relevant to the project you are working on, and ideally as short as possible. Public repos are visible to everyone on the internet, while private repos are only visible to you and any collaborators you invite. Readme files are useful for providing an overview of the project and instructions for getting started -- it is worth initializing one. Gitignore files and licenses are optional -- gitignore files specify which files should be ignored by Git when pushing updates, while licenses specify the terms under which others can use your code. When using R-based projects, you may want to select the R gitignore template, which will ignore common files generated by R and RStudio that are not actually relevant from a version control perspective. You can add additional files, folders, and file types to the gitignore later if needed; an example of when you might do this is if you are working with large or sensitive data files.\n\n## Alternative to Creating a Repository: Forking a Repository\n\nForking creates your own copy of someone else’s repository, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original project. This is ideal when contributing to open-source projects or experimenting with new ideas. It is also a good way of making sure that the original repository remains stable, as any changes to it need to be approved by the repository owner.\n\nWhen working with the DC's repositories, you will typically fork the repository to your own GitHub account, make changes in your fork, and then create a pull request to propose changes to the original repository. This method prevents version clashes if multiple contributors are working on the same project.\n\nThe following demonstrates the forking process for the DC's `projects` repo.\n\nSteps of forking a repository:\n\n1.  Navigate to the repository page in your browser: `https://github.com/ucrdatacenter/projects`.\n2.  Click the `Fork` button at the top-right corner of the page.\n3.  Select your GitHub account as the destination for the fork.\n4.  Now you have a new repository in your account that is a copy of the original repository. It has the same title as the original repo, but you are the owner of it instead of the DC organization.\n\nForking is especially beneficial for collaboration. It ensures you can test and develop features independently before proposing changes to the main project.\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"workflows_files/fork.png\")\n```\n\n## Cloning a repository\n\nCloning a repository is useful when you want to work on an existing project (whether a new or forked repo) locally. It is the most convenient way of working with files, as you can make changes while working normally in your local directory and with any software installed on your computer.\n\nSteps:\n\n1.  Open GitHub Desktop.\n2.  Go to `File > Clone Repository...`.\n3.  Choose the repository you want to clone from the list (refresh the list if needed). **Note:** when cloning forked repos, make sure to clone your fork, i.e. the repository in your account, not the original repository in the DC organization.\n4.  Choose a local path where the repository will be saved and click `Clone`. It is a good practice to create a `GitHub` folder in your main documents directory, and clone all repos there.\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"workflows_files/clone.png\")\n```\n\n### Making Commits and Pushing Changes\n\nCommits are snapshots of your changes that you save to the repository. Pushing these changes updates the repository on GitHub, making them available to collaborators.\n\nSteps:\n\n1.  Make changes to the files in your local repository. E.g. open the project from your file explorer in RStudio, or open a file with your preferred text editor.\n2.  Open GitHub Desktop, where your changed files will be listed.\n3.  Write a clear and descriptive commit message summarizing your changes (e.g., \"Fixed error in data cleaning script\").\n4.  Click `Commit to main` to save the snapshot locally.\n5.  Push your changes to GitHub by clicking the `Push origin` button.\n\nCommits and pushes are essential for maintaining a history of changes and sharing updates with collaborators. They ensure transparency and accountability in project development. They also allow you to go back to previous versions without difficulty if needed. Note that a commit is a local operation, i.e. it's tracked locally, but not shared on GitHub or with any of your collaborators until you push the changes.\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"workflows_files/commit.png\")\n```\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"workflows_files/push.png\")\n```\n\n### Creating a Pull Request\n\nA pull request is a way to propose changes to the original repository from a fork. It allows the repository owner to review your modifications before merging them into the main repository. That is, pull requests are how you move the changes you made in your fork back to the original repository.\n\nSteps:\n\n1.  Open your forked repository on GitHub.\n2.  Click the `Branch` tab on the toolbar and select `Create new pull request`. This action will bring you to the GitHub page for creating a pull request.\n3.  Select the original repository as the base and your forked repository as the compare.\n4.  Add a title and description for your pull request explaining the changes you’ve made.\n5.  Click `Create pull request`.\n\nPull requests are valuable for collaborative projects, as they allow for feedback and discussion before changes are finalized.\n\n```{r}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"workflows_files/pr.png\")\n```\n\n**Note:** creating a pull request does not notify the repo owners, so if you want them to merge your pull request, you need to inform them that you made a request. For DC repos, the easiest way to do so is to send an email to [datacenter\\@ucr.nl](mailto:datacenter@ucr.nl).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Part 2: Introduction to Markdown Documents with Quarto\n\n## What is Markdown?\n\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language used to create formatted text with plain text editors. It’s widely used for documentation because of its simplicity and readability. Quarto extends Markdown with additional features to create professional documents, including reports, presentations, and technical analyses.\n\nIf you are familiar with LaTeX, Markdown is a simpler alternative for creating documents. It allows you to focus on content rather than formatting, making it ideal for writing reports, notes, and documentation.\n\nIf you are familiar with RMarkdown, you can think of Quarto as RMarkdown with a lot of additional features.\n\n## Creating a Quarto Document\n\nQuarto documents are ideal for reproducible research and professional reporting. To create a Quarto document, open RStudio, and instead of creating a plan R script, create a new Quarto document via `File > New File > Quarto Document`. If you don't see this option, you may need to first install Quarto from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).\n\nA new `.qmd` file will be generated, with some sample content. You'll see three main elements in the file.\n\n### YAML Header\n\nThe YAML header defines metadata for the document, such as the title, author, and output format. It’s placed at the top of the file and surrounded by triple dashes (`---`).\n\nFor the output format, you can choose from various options, such as HTML, PDF, or Word. The output format determines how the document will be rendered. You can compile to HTML without any additional software (`format: html`), but for PDFs (`format: pdf`), you will need to have a LaTeX installation on your system. In addition, `format: docx` will create a Word document. For each output format, you can customize many features of the output in the YAML header. For example, [this page](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html) shows the options for HTML output.\n\nThe YAML header also specifies global options for the execution and display of code. You can choose whether to display code and/or results, whether to evaluate code chunks, and whether to display messages, warnings, and errors. You can always override these options for individual code chunks.\n\n### Plain Text and Formatting\n\nUse plain text for content and Markdown syntax for formatting:\n\n-   **Headings**: Use `#`, `##`, and `###` for different heading levels. Headings help structure your document.\n\n    ``` markdown\n    # Heading 1\n    ## Heading 2\n    ### Heading 3\n    ```\n\n-   **Lists**: Create lists to organize information clearly. Use `-` for unordered lists or numbers for ordered lists. You can create nested lists by indenting (4 spaces per level).\n\n    ``` markdown\n    - Item 1\n    - Item 2\n      - Subitem 2.1\n    ```\n\n-   **Text Formatting**: Use `*italic*` or `**bold**` to emphasize text.\n\n    ``` markdown\n    *italic*, **bold**\n    ```\n\n### Code Chunks\n\nCode chunks allow you to embed and execute code within the document. They are enclosed by triple backticks with a language specifier:\n\n```` markdown\n```{r}\n# Example of an R code chunk\nsummary(iris)\n```\n````\n\nCode chunks are essential for integrating analysis directly into the document, ensuring that when you compile your document, the latest version of the code is executed and the results are displayed.\n\nIf you want to override the global options for a specific code chunk, you can do so by specifying the options within the curly braces. For example, you can choose not to display the code in the output by setting `echo = FALSE`.\n\n```` markdown\n```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# Suppress code and warnings\nsummary(iris)\n```\n````\n\n### Math Notation\n\nQuarto supports mathematical notation using LaTeX syntax. For example:\n\n-   Inline: `$E = mc^2$`\n\n-   Block:\n\n    ``` markdown\n    $$\n    \\int_0^1 x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{1}{3}\n    $$\n    ```\n\nMath notation is especially useful in technical and scientific reports.\n\n### Fenced Divs\n\nA special feature of Quarto is fenced divs, which allow you to create custom blocks of content. Some are pre-defined, such as `callout-note`, `callout-warning`, and `callout-tip`, which create callout boxes with different styles. You can also define your own custom divs for specific content.\n\n``` markdown\n:::: {.callout-note}\n## Note\nThis is a callout box.\n::::\n```\n\n## Rendering the Document\n\nTo render a Quarto document:\n\n1.  Save the `.qmd` file.\n2.  Click the `Render` button in RStudio (Ctrl+Shift+K).\n\nRendering produces the final output, such as HTML or PDF, making your analysis and documentation accessible.\n\n## Quarto Documentation\n\nQuarto has very extensive and user-friendly documentation. You can access it at [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/).\n\n# Case study: Apprenticeship presentation slides with Quarto and RevealJS\n\nDuring the workshop, we will create a presentation slide deck using Quarto and RevealJS. You may want to take this opportunity to experiment with Quarto's capabilities, and also to start thinking about you final presentation.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)\n```\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial, we will explore how to use GitHub and Quarto to streamline your workflows, improve collaboration, and create professional, reproducible documents.\n\nThis tutorial is divided into two parts:\n\n1.
