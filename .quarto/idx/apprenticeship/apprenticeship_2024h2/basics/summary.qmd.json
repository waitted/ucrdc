There are a few packages available for generating simple summary statistics tables that contain information about the central tendencies and dispersion of the data, such as `vtable` or `stargazer` (with many more available). These packages all have different default settings, output types, and customization options.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(vtable)\nlibrary(stargazer)\n\n# vtable\n\ndata |> \n  # by default creates HTML table; out = \"csv\" returns a dataframe\n  # can change which descriptives to keep\n  # can report group-level descriptives\n  sumtable(out = \"csv\", group = \"reading\")\n\n# stargazer\n\ndata |> \n  # input needs to be a data.frame, not tibble\n  as.data.frame() |> \n  # default output is LaTeX table\n  # can be exported with the out argument or a following write() function\n  # can change which descriptives to keep or omit\n  # limited to numeric variables\n  stargazer(type = \"text\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can define our own summary statistics with the `dplyr` functions `group_by()` and `summarize()`, which also easily allows the calculation of more complex descriptive statistics, including grouped statistics based on categorical variables. The `across()` helper function in the `summarize()` function can be used to apply the same calculation to multiple variables at once: it requires the first argument as the list of variables (potentially with the help of selector functions) and the function we'd like to apply.\n\n```{r}\n# tibble of mean and sd for a single variable\ndata |> \n  summarize(mean_grade = mean(grade),\n            sd_grade = sd(grade))\n\n# mean and sd of age and grade variables, grouped by reading\ndata |> \n  group_by(reading) |> \n  # .names allows overriding default option to reuse original column names\n  summarize(across(c(age, grade), mean, .names = \"mean_{.col}\"),\n            across(c(age, grade), sd, .names = \"sd_{.col}\"))\n\n# mean of all numeric variables, grouped by reading\ndata |> \n  group_by(reading) |> \n  # where() is a helper function evaluating the contents of variables\n  # specify full function call with ~ at the start and .x replacing the variable name\n  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))\n\n# mean of all variables with names containing the letter a\ndata |> \n  summarize(across(contains(\"a\"), ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))\n\n# sample size of each group and correlation between age and grade per group\ndata |> \n  group_by(reading, listening) |> \n  summarize(age_grade_correlation = cor(age, grade),\n            n = n())\n```\n\nThe list of helper functions that can be used instead of listing which variables to include/exclude is in the help file accessible with `?dplyr_tidy_select`.\n\nTo export a descriptive statistics table, we can use the relevant `write...()` function shown in the data importing section (e.g. `write_csv()` for tibbles, general `write()` for HTML, plain text, LaTeX, other general types). CSV tables already copy nicely into e.g. MS Word. If using LaTeX or RMarkdown, the `knitr` package contains the `kable()` function that directly improves on the design of the table without needing formatting afterwards.\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\ndata |> \n  count(reading, listening) |> \n  write_csv(\"table1.csv\")\n```\n\n```{r}\ndata |> \n  count(reading, listening) |> \n  # knitr:: allows using function from the package without library(knitr)\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n\n# Go to\n\n-   [Introduction to R](../intro)\n-   [Finding and importing data](../import)\n-   [Data cleaning with `dplyr`](../clean)\n-   [Data visualization with `ggplot2`](../ggplot)\n-   [Hypothesis testing / modelling](../tests)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE)\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndata <- read_csv(\"data/data.csv\")\n```\n\nTo get a descriptive statistic of a single variable in a tibble, we can use that variable as an argument to a relevant function (using `$` to refer to a variable in a tibble).\n\n```{r}\nmean(data$age)\nmedian(data$age)\nsd(data$grade)\n```\n\nTo get the frequencies of a categorical variable, we can use the `count()` function, with the `sort = TRUE` argument returning the values in descending frequency. `count()` is a tidy function that works well with pipe workflows and can count the joint frequencies of multiple variables.\n\n```{r}\n# frequencies of a single variable\ncount(data, reading)\n\n# joint frequency distribution\ncount(data, reading, listening, notes)\n```\n\nTo get the correlation coefficient between two variables, we can use the `cor()` function in the same way we used other descriptives such as `mean()`.\n\n```{r}\ncor(data$age, data$grade)\n```\n\nThe easiest way to get summary statistics of all variables in a tibble is with the `summary()` function: this function shows the distribution of numeric variables, the frequencies of categorical variables, and the number of missing values for each variable.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(data)\n```\n\nThe `summary()` function is useful for viewing the data in the Console, but doesn't export to outside of R nicely.
