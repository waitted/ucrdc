A vector is a collection of values of the same type, such as numbers, characters, or logicals (TRUE/FALSE). You can create a vector with the `c()` function, which stands for concatenate. If you assign a vector to an object with the assignment operator `<-`, your vector will be saved in your environment so you can work with it within your current R session. Some examples of creating vectors are:\n\n```{r}\nv1 <- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\")\nv2 <- 25\nv3 <- 1:10\n```\n\nTo subset or extract elements from a vector, you can use square brackets `[ ]` with an index. For example, `v1[1]` returns the first element of `v1`, `v3[2:5]` returns the 2nd to 5th elements of `v3`, and `v3[-c(2, 4, 6)]` returns all but the 2nd, 4th and 6th elements of `v3`.\n\n```{r}\nv1[1]\nv3[2:5]\nv3[-c(2, 4, 6)]\n```\n\nA dataframe (or tibble in `tidyverse`) is a special type of object that combines vectors into a rectangular table. Each column of a dataframe is a vector, and each row is an observation. usually you would load data from an external source, but you can create a dataframe with the `data.frame()` and a tibble with the `tibble()` function. You can also convert other data types such as matrices to tibbles with the `as_tibble()` function. Both functions take vectors as their arguments. Tibbles are preferred because they are more modern and have some convenient features that dataframes don't, but for the most part, differences are minor and for the most part it does not matter whether you work with tibbles or dataframes.\n\nA simple example of creating a tibble is (make sure to load `tidyverse first`):\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# define vectors within the tibble() function\ntibble(\n  name = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Chris\"),\n  height = c(165, 180, 175)\n)\n\n# define the vectors first, then combine them into a tibble\nname <- c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Chris\")\nheight <- c(165, 180, 175)\ntibble(name, height)\n```\n\n## Functions in R\n\nFunctions are reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task. They take arguments as inputs and return one or more pieces of output. You will mostly work with functions loaded from various packages or from the base R distribution, and in some cases you may write your own functions to avoid repetition or improve the readability of your code. We will cover writing your own functions later in the program.\n\nAs with vectors, the output of a function is saved to your environment only if you assign the result to an object. For example, `sum(x)` will display the sum of the elements of the vector `x`, but `sum <- sum(x)` will save this result to an object.\n\n```{r}\nx <- c(1, 5, 6, 2, 1, 8)\n\nsum(x)\nsum <- sum(x)\n```\n\nSome important functions on vectors are\n\n```{r}\nmean(x) # return the mean; add the argument na.rm = TRUE if missing values should be excluded\nlength(x) # give the length of the vector (number of elements)\nunique(x) # list the unique elements of the vector\n```\n\nTo learn more about a function and its arguments, you can use the ? operator or the help() function, for example by typing `?sum` (or equivalently, `?sum()`). It is good practice to request help files from your console and not you R script, since there is no need to save these queries for the future.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE)\n```\n\n## First steps\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you have already installed R and RStudio and are familiar with how to run code in RStudio.
