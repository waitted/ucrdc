Compare your own output to what you see printed below to make sure all of your code runs as expected.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn some cases you might need to do additional calculations with your data. In this tutorial, we show you how to define new variables and overwrite existing ones using the `mutate()` function from `tidyverse` functions and the `diamonds` dataset (which comes pre-loaded with `tidyverse` so you don't need to import it).\n\nLet's load the `tidyverse` package and have a look at the `diamonds` dataset:\n\n```{r}\n# load tidyverse\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# add diamonds to the environment\ndata(diamonds)\n```\n\n## Creating new variables\n\nThe `mutate()` function is used to create new variables in a dataset. The syntax is `mutate(data, variable = expression)`. The `data` argument is the dataset you want to modify, `variable` is the name of the new variable, and `expression` is the calculation you want to perform. If `variable` already exists in the dataset, `mutate()` will overwrite it.\n\nLet's create a new variable called `price_per_carat` that calculates the price per carat of each diamond:\n\n```{r}\n# create a new variable price_per_carat\nmutate(diamonds, price_per_carat = price / carat)\n```\n\nYou can also create multiple variables at once by separating them with a comma. It is good practice to start each new variable on a new line to keep your code readable.\n\nLet's create a second variable: a logical (TRUE/FALSE) variable that checks if the diamond costs more than \\$10,000. In this case, the expression is a logical condition.\n\n```{r}\n# create two new variables\nmutate(diamonds,\n       price_per_carat = price / carat,\n       expensive = price > 10000)\n```\n\nTo be able to work with this new dataset, you need to save it to a new object. Let's assign the result of the `mutate()` function to a new object called `diamonds_new`:\n\n```{r}\n# save the result to a new object\ndiamonds_new <- mutate(diamonds,\n                        price_per_carat = price / carat,\n                        expensive = price > 10000)\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE)\n```\n\n## Video tutorial\n\nPlease watch [this video (2:46)](https://vimeo.com/1011766337/7659d00d22), then read and follow along with the written tutorial below.
