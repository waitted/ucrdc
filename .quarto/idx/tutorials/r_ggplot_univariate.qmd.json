Other than the name of the dataset and the variable that you want to plot, no additional arguments need to be specified; but you can customize the plot by adding arguments to the `geom_` functions.\n\n```{r}\n# basic histogram of price\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n# custom binwidth or bins determine the number of bins\n# with binwidth = 1000, each bin is $1,000 wide\n# color affects the border; fill affects the inside\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, color = \"black\", fill = \"lightblue\")\n\n# density plot\n# alpha adjusts the transparency of the fill\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.5)\n\n# boxplot\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n# The distribution of a discrete variable\n\nTo compare the frequencies of discrete variables, you can use a bar plot.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n\nIf you want R to automatically count the frequencies of your variable, use `geom_bar()` with only an `x` aesthetic. If you have a separate variable that contains the frequencies (e.g. as the result of a `count()` function), you can use `geom_col()` with both an `x` and `y` aesthetic.\n\nNote that the following code uses the pipe operator `|>` to chain the functions together. The pipe operator is used to pass the output of one function as the first input to the next function, making the code more readable. To read more about the pipe operator, see the tutorial on the [tidy workflow](../r_intro_workflow).\n\n```{r}\ndiamonds |> \n  count(cut) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = cut, y = n)) +\n  geom_col()\n```\n\n# Adding labels\n\nWhenever you make a plot, make sure to use clear labels and titles with the `labs()` function to make your visualization easy to understand.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(title = \"Frequencies of diamond cuts\",\n       x = \"Cut\",\n       y = \"Number of diamonds\")\n```\n\nTo learn more about other geoms and customization options, have a look at our [other tutorials](../) and [additional resources](../links#Help%20with%20%60ggplot%60).\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE)\n```\n\n# Video tutorial\n\nPlease watch [this](https://vimeo.com/1011773578/3fc4a9fa21) video (4:40), then read and follow along with the written tutorial below.
