For example, you can plot the relationship between price and carat by specifying these variables as the x and y aesthetics:\n\n```{r}\n# basic scatter plot\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = carat)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nFitting a smooth curve or a linear regression line to the scatter plot can help you see the overall trend in the data.\n\n```{r}\n# scatter plot with fitted smooth curve\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = carat)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth()\n\n# scatter plot with linear regression line\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = carat)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  # method = \"lm\" fits a linear model, se = FALSE removes the confidence interval\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)\n```\n\nCategorical variables can be used to show the distribution of continuous variables by group. You can put a categorical variable on one of the axes, or use it on another aesthetic, such as the fill or color. Note that if a variable determines the fill, the color, and the shape of the points, that has to be specified inside an `aes()` function, while if the characteristic is pre-defined, then it goes outside the `aes()` function. Also note that if you specify aesthetics in the main `ggplot()` function, then they apply to all geoms, while if you specify them in a `geom_...()` function, they apply only to that geom.\n\n```{r}\n# box plot of price by cut\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = cut)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n# density plot of price by cut\nggplot(diamonds) +\n  geom_density(aes(x = price, fill = cut), alpha = 0.5)\n```\n\nTo plot two categorical variables, you can use a bar plot with an extra grouping argument. For example, we can plot the number of diamonds with each combination of cut and color:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = color)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n# to put the bars next to each other instead of on top, specify the position\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = color)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n```\n\nWhenever you make a plot, make sure to use clear labels and titles with the `labs()` function to make your visualization easy to understand.\n\n```{r}\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = carat)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Relationship between price and carat\",\n       x = \"Price of diamond\",\n       y = \"Carat of diamond\")\n```\n\nTo learn more about other geoms and customization options, have a look at our [advanced visualization tutorial](../r_adv_ggplot) and [additional resources](../links#Help%20with%20%60ggplot%60).\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE)\n```\n\n# Introduction\n\nBefore you proceed, make sure you're familiar with the logic of `ggplot`, as explained in our [introduction to `ggplot` tutorial](../r_ggplot_intro.qmd).\n\nWe'll use the `diamonds` dataset that comes pre-loaded with `tidyverse` to demonstrate how to plot relationships between two variables, so let's load `tidyverse` and have a look at the dataset:\n\n```{r}\n# load tidyverse\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# add diamonds to the environment\ndata(diamonds)\n```\n\n# Bivariate plots\n\nYou can plot two continuous variables with a scatter plot.
