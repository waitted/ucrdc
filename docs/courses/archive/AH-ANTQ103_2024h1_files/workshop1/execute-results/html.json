For further information, please refer to the R documentation.\n\nR can be used as a basic calculator. Try the following operations. The output will be printed in the console (below). Please note that adding spaces between the numbers and the operators is not necessary, but it makes the code more readable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n1 - 1\n2 * 3\n4 / 2\n2 ^ 3\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere we also take some time to introduce the notation in this file. The grey blocks are the code blocks. You can run this either in the console or in a script.\n\n## Variables\n\nR can also be used to assign values to variables. Try the following operations. These variables should be added to the environment pane (On the right) Assign the value 1 to the variable x. Note that the arrow can be typed by pressing Alt + -, as well as by typing \\<- manually. Also assign the value 2 to the variable y.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 1\ny <- 2\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can now use these variables in calculations. Try the following operations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx + y\nx - y\nx * y\nx / y\nx ^ y\n```\n:::\n\n\nSometimes it is useful to find the sum of a vector. We can do this using the `sum` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(x)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can also find the mean and length of a vector, as well as the unique values in a vector.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(x)\nlength(x)\nunique(c(x, x))\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about a function, you can add a question mark before the function name. This will open the documentation for the function (In the bottom right). At the bottom of the documentation, there are some examples of how to use the function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?sum\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Characters\n\nR can also assign characters or strings to variables or vectors. Assign the string \"Hello\" to the variable x and the string \"World\" to the variable y.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- \"Hello\"\ny <- \"World\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen we try adding these two words together, we get an error. This is because R does not know how to add strings together.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx + y\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can concatenate strings together using the paste function. Note that the default separator is a space.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npaste(x, y)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can also concatenate strings together using the c function. This, however, creates a vector of characters instead of a single string.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc(x, y)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Tidyverse\n\nAt UCR, we generally use the tidyverse package a lot to manipulate data. This package contains a lot of useful functions for data manipulation. We can install the tidyverse package using the `install.packages` function. You should only need to run this once. If you rerun this notebook, you can comment out this line using a hashtag.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can load the tidyverse package using the `library` function. This should be run every time you start a new R session.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can now use data structures from the tidyverse package. For example, we can create a tibble, which is a type of data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble <- tibble(\n  name = c(\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Joe\"),\n  age = c(20, 21, 22)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAlternatively, we can first create a vector for each column, and then use the `tibble` function to create the tibble.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nname <- c(\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Joe\")\nage <- c(20, 21, 22)\ntibble <- tibble(name, age)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe then have several ways to look at the data. Try them out!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble\nprint(tibble)\nView(tibble)\nglimpse(tibble)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf we have a dataset with a lot of numeric variables, we can use the `summary` function to get a quick overview of the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(tibble)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf we want to look at a specific column, we can use the `$` operator. This will return a vector.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble$name\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The pipe operator\n\nThe pipe operator is a very useful operator in R. It allows us to chain together multiple operations. This makes our code more readable. It can be typed by pressing Ctrl + Shift + M, as well as by typing `%>%` manually.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble %>% \n  View()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The filter function\n\nThe `filter` function allows us to filter rows in a tibble. This is useful for selecting a subset of the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble %>% \n  filter(age > 20) %>% \n  print()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe inner workings of the filter function are as follows. The first argument is the tibble. The second argument is the condition. The condition is a logical vector. This means that it is a vector of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values. `TRUE` means that the row is kept, and `FALSE` means that the row is removed. This shows the logical vector that is actually used by the filter function. Rows with `TRUE` are kept and rows with `FALSE` are removed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble$age > 20\n```\n:::\n\n\nIt is also possible to filter on strings. This is done using the `==` operator.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble %>% \n  filter(name == \"John\") %>% \n  print()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The select function\n\nThe `select` function allows us to select columns in a tibble. This is useful for selecting a subset of the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble %>% \n  select(name) %>% \n  print()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The mutate function\n\nThe `mutate` function allows us to create new columns in a tibble. This is useful for creating new variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble %>% \n  mutate(age_squared = age ^ 2) %>% \n  View()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## NA values\n\n`NA` values are missing values. These are values that are not defined. We can create `NA` values using the `NA` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nNA\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can also create `NA` values in a tibble.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble <- tibble(\n  name = c(\"John\", \"Jane\", \"Joe\"),\n  age = c(20, NA, 22)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can then use the `print` function to print the tibble.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(tibble)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf we want to know what rows contain `NA` values, we can use the `is.na` function inside the `filter`. Note that this returns a vector of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values. TRUE means that the value is `NA`, and `FALSE` means that the value is not `NA`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nis.na(tibble$age)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis means we can use `is.na()` inside the `filter` function to filter rows that contain NA values. Note that we define the column age in the `is.na()` function as we want R to check for NA values in the age column.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble %>% \n  filter(is.na(age)) %>% \n  View()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen using the \"not\" operator (`!`) we can filter rows that do not contain `NA` values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble %>% \n  filter(!is.na(age)) %>% \n  View()\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can also use the `drop_na()` function to drop rows that contain `NA` values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble %>% \n  drop_na() %>% \n  View()\n```\n:::\n\n\nA difference between the `is.na()` function and the `drop_na()` function is that in `is.na()` you must specify the column, but in `drop_na()` you do not need to specify the column (Do keep in mind that this will thus remove all rows that have an `NA` in any column).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble %>% \n  filter(!is.na()) %>% \n  View()\n\ntibble %>%\n  drop_na() %>%\n  View()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Loading external data\n\nData link [here](https://www.carc.ox.ac.uk/XDB/ASP/searchOpen.asp?setResultCheckboxes=chkAlbum&chkAlbum=true&windowWidth=1535&windowHeight=689&search=%20%7BAND%7D%20%20%5BProvenance%5D%20GREECE%2C%20ATHENS%2C%20AGORA#aHeader).\n\nWe can then use the read_csv function to read the data from a URL and save it as a variable. This will return a tibble. We assign it to the variable `data`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- read_csv(\"https://github.com/ucrdatacenter/projects/raw/main/AH-ANTQ103/2024h1/Beazley_Archive.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Assignment 1\n\nBased on the tibble we created in step 5, create a new column called age_in_20_years. This should contain the age in 20 years. Then, filter the tibble to only contain rows where the age in 20 years is greater than 40. Finally, print the tibble.\n\n## Assignment 2\n\nAssignment 2: Using the Beazley Archive data, create two new data sets. Give them descriptive names. The first data set should only contain rows using an Athenian fabric (So without any specifics).\n\nThe second data set should only contain rows using Geometric Athenian fabrics. Which data set has more rows?\n",
